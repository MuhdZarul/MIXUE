# MIXUE Ordering System

# Introduction

For the chain brand MIXUE, which is popular for its trendy ice cream and freshly brewed tea drinks, our group proposed a web application ordering system. The application, which will be created with the Laravel framework, attempts to give MIXUE customers a convenient and effective way to place online orders.

The application allows for a seamless interaction between the user interface, business logic, and data management by utilizing Laravel's Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. We'll integrate features like secure checkout, real-time order tracking, and easy-to-use navigation. Important Laravel technologies will speed up development and provide a stable and dependable system, such as PHP Artisan CLI for command-line interactions, Blade Templating Engine for dynamic views, and Eloquent ORM for database administration.

The system fills a significant gap in MIXUE's digital strategy by addressing the company's lack of an online ordering platform. In addition to improving customer convenience, this platform will maximize MIXUE's operational effectiveness and increase its sales in the competitive ice cream and beverage industry.

# Challenge and Difficulties to Develop the Application
### 1. First-Time Use of GitHub
As this was our first time using GitHub, we faced challenges in connecting the Laravel project to GitHub. We managed to overcome this by learning from YouTube tutorials and help from our friends.
### 2. Database Relationship Management
We encountered difficulties in connecting relationships between tables in the database due to differences in attribute names, particularly in tables with foreign key constraints. We resolved this by standardizing and aligning the attribute names.
### 3. Fear of Committing and Pushing Changes
We also feel a little bit afraid to COMMIT & PUSH because we were worried it might affect the work of other group members. We managed to solve it by gradually building our confidence and ensuring proper testing and review before pushing changes.
### 4. Unfamiliar with Jetstream and Live-wire Packages
We learnt to do the form automatically but when we tried to edit for authentication it is harder because the files is not made by us. 
While doing the authentication the role could not be setup for admin and customer due to migration problem.
